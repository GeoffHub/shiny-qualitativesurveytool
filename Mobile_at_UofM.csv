Microsoft has proved time and again that none of its products can be considered secure, and we now know that both of these companies, among others, willingly introduced backdoors into their products for the purpose of government surveillance. / (3) UofM Secure is the only of the three primary 802.11 networks which is encrypted, but it is totally unusable during peak hours, at least in Tate lab, where I work.",,,,,,,,,,Peers,,Google or other search tool,,,,,"(1) The very first priority needs to be improving the UofM Secure infrastructure so that it can provide fast, reliable connections everywhere on campus and during peak hours. Unencrypted connections are totally unacceptable, and there are too many places on campus where cellular reception is poor or nonexistent to justify not providing WiFi. / (2) The website's mobile format needs to be expanded to include much more than it does, for example, all of the course scheduling pages on OneStop. Also, the webpages need to be changed to present the information that people actually want; for example, OneStop should default to Home instead of News. / (3) Dependence of University webpages on JavaScript should be reduced as much as possible. It is a security concern, and I do not necessarily consider the University's sites secure or trustworthy enough to enable such functionality blindly. Note that some University pages default to desktop forms when JavaScript is disabled, even on mobile devices. / (4) Improve the University's website in general. http://xkcd.com/773",No,,,,

I can do everything on an ipad that could've been done with the previous method of providing a course packet. I would much rather spend twenty dollars on a course pack than five hundred dollars on a device to read files. Additionally, you all need to do some research about how too much screen time damages your vision. It is as if this gets entirely ignored. It's fine to try and experiment with technology and if you want every class to have a moodle component, that's okay. However, my most sincere gripe with this hasty transition towards hybrid online courses is the fact that all of my reading is done on screens.

There is currently a bare minimum of wireless phone service available to us, and most of us cannot receive service at all.  Theatre students are very busy and most of our meetings deal with larger groups of people.  We need to be able to communicate quickly and effectively, as an unexpected change in schedule can affect large groups of people.  Such changes could include a professor being late to class and needing a TA to take over for a few minutes, or a student needing to reschedule a costume fitting, or a group meeting to rehearse a scene.  One of the most valuable things a theatre major can have is their ability to communicate efficiently.  We currently do not have this ability, and while the lack of wireless service hasn't caused any train wrecks, there have been numerous occasions when having adequate cell phone service would have saved time and worry.  I feel that before the university focuses on improving the online tools available to students on their mobile phones, they should first focus on making sure that students can actually access those tools.",No,mart3005@d.umn.edu,,,

Most times when I try to use Moodle from my phone I'm just checking to see if my professor posted grades yet.,"As far as I know there isn't a Moodle app for iPhone that works with the U's Moodle configuration, which is a shame. When I attempt to use Moodle from my phone's web browser it's incredibly cumbersome because there is no mobile device-optimized site. Since I realize it'd be difficult to continually update an app due to how customized our version of Moodle is, it would be fantastic if a mobile site were implemented",,,Mildly,-I keep my assignments organized with iOS's Reminders / -I keep assorted lists of things to do/get in iOS's Notes / -I access Google Drive to view and sometimes edit group assignments / -I access Gmail to communicate with classmates/professors / -I watch YouTube videos to help clarify difficult concepts from class / -I use my phone camera to take pictures of lengthy notes in lecture or important things in labs so I can come back to them later,Access / View,Access / View,Access / View,,Access / View,Access / View,,,Access / View,Access / View,,,Edit / Change,Edit / Change,,Edit / Change,Edit / Change,,,Edit / Change,Edit / Change,,,Create / Produce,Create / Produce,,Create / Produce,Create / Produce,,,Create / Produce,Create / Produce,,,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,,,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,Google Drive,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.03,0.1,0.96,4.96,3,"No, I do not have security concerns using my mobile on campus",,,,,,,,,,,Peers,,Google or other search tool,,,"I wasn't aware of any tools or apps that the U provides besides Moodle, but I suppose my most-visited website is One Stop","I don't know that I have any particularly innovative ways, but I often use the long bus ride to St. Paul as an opportunity to watch YouTube videos about concepts I'm learning in class",Improving wifi connectivity is imperative! There are certain classrooms/sections of buildings that are dead zones and it makes it hard both for teachers to present things if they're not plugged in and for students to access the internet to aid in learning.

I find moodle to be fairly inconvenient as I try to limit the amount of time I spend on my computer and truthfully, the internet is a distracting place. While the moodle mobile site is fairly usable for checking assignments and logistical questions about classes on the go, it still presents inconveniences that could be avoided if professors were to actually go over due dates/assignments in class rather than leaving it up to moodle. The mobile site requires a tedious log-in (as does gmail.umn.edu).  An app could have you constantly logged in an enable push notifications to alert you of upcoming assignments, new assignments that are posted, changes to syllabuses, and even alert you when a class has been cancelled. Also communication on moodle is poor at best. Posting to a forum is likely to get a response much too late, and it may not even receive a satisfactory answer. Somebody may know the answer, but never see the post as it is unrealistic to constantly be on moodle. It'd be most convenient to be alerted when you actually need to look, rather than a guess and check method. Forum posts could allow instant communication to anyone with the app, as they'd be notified immediately, including staff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Often,Often,,,Never,Sometimes,,,Often,"I often use my smartphone to bring course readings to class, rather than printing off them myself.","That'd be cool, but makes no sense as assignments are usually required in word docs/powerpoints/formats that you'd use a computer for anyway.",,,,"Only if I am very, very, desperate.",,,I tried checking grades today actually.

Being permanently logged in would be helpful with the app (you can password protect apps) so I don't see much of a security flaw. /  / P.S. Awhile back I saw there was a moodle app created but I  neglected getting it as it had a 1/5 star rating. After writing this I reviewed the comments on it and it seems nobody could get it to work, but the few that did found it helpful.

","I think the biggest frustration I've had with using my mobile device on campus is that wi fi connection can be inconsistent. I'm almost always able to access wi fi, but my phone never connects instantly to campus wi fi, even though I use it every day. I always have to sign in. And it doesn't always stay connected after I've signed in. If I move locations, I always have to sign in all over again.
